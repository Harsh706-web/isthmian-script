# 🖥️ isthmian-script - Analyze Language Families Easily

## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the isthmian-script project! This application helps you compare Bayesian models to evaluate language family hypotheses. Focused on the undeciphered Isthmian script, it uses advanced phonotactic analysis without needing any prior knowledge of the script.
